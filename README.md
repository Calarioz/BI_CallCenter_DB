This is a DEMO of a call center easy dashboard to interact with.

On page 1 we can review the average entry calls vs calls taken, the volume of calls and the earlang C formula applied to know how many agents we require according to the volumne of calls for that month/day.
We can also emulate the service level and shrinkage to visualize the increment/decrement of agents required, and a table with the records of calls per supervisor and agent.

On page 2 we can check details per agent classify by supervisor to get specific metrics on their performance.
